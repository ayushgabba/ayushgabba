# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush Gabba

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a passionate Computer Science undergrad with a strong interest in **cloud computing**, **software development**, and **data-driven applications**. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech at the **University of Petroleum and Energy Studies**, Dehradun, where I'm also specializing in Cloud Computing.

I love building scalable applications, exploring emerging tech, and working on impactful projects — from healthcare prediction systems to full-fledged cloud-hosted platforms. When I'm not coding, I enjoy volunteering and contributing to initiatives that make a real difference.
